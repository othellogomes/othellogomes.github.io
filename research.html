  <h2> PicoCal: R&D for LHCb's ECAL Upgrades Ib and II</h2>
    <u1>
      <li>May 2024 - August 2025</li>
    </u1>
    <p> 
      After the FCCee project, I was determined to pursue HEP research and consulted with LHCb faculty, Prof. Phoebe Hamilton regarding my interest. 
      I thus began working on the R&D of the ECAL's Upgrade II, doing linearity tests for multianode and single anode PMTs that will be installed during Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) and subsequently LS4. 
      I tested different characteristics (such as amplitude and charge) of the PMTs to determine this but setup wise, the process was simply executed by flipping between two OD filters in the blackbox.

<h2> Comparison of Simulation Tools for Precise Two-Photon Background EWK Z Boson Measurements at the FCC - MIT </h2>
  <u1>
    <li>January 2024 - June 2024</li>
  </u1>
  <p>This project was for a Particle Physics class that I took with Dr. Christopher Palmer in the Spring of 2024 and the projects done were jointly between UMD and MIT. 
    There were 3 undergraduate students in my group (including myself) and we were being advised by a graduate student, Luca Lavezzo, a post-doctoral scholar, Dr. Jan Eysermans, and a faculty member, Dr. Christoph Paus. 
    At UMD, we were being advised by Dr. Chris Palmer. We worked on simulating the two photon virtual background from Z Boson collision event via Monte Carlo generators (Whizard3 and Pythia8). 
    We analyzed various kinematic properties by plotting the invariant mass, pseudorapidity, luminosity, four-vector momentum, and cuts of each segment of the event.</p>
