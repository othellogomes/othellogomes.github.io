        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello there, my name is Othello (they/he). I am currently a Ph.D. student in physics at the University of Cincinnati,
            aspiring to go into experimental High Energy Physics and detector R&amp;D. I am currently a Teaching Assistant for
            General &amp; College Physics II Labs for Fall 2025. Previously, I was an undergraduate physics student at the
            University of Maryland, College Park. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at UMD, I was involved in a few projects ranging from theory to experiment: exoplanet astrophysics,
            quantum information science, and particle physics. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>
        <p>
            I was recently involved with the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) flavor physics group, where I am being supervised
            by Prof. Phoebe Hamilton on R&amp;D for the LHCb experiment’s ECAL for Upgrades Ib and II, an effort known as PicoCal
            within the collaboration. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to that, I worked on the analysis of the Z-Hadronic cross section comparing the difference between two MC
            generators in the background and using the uncertainty of it to apply cuts to final states of Z, in affiliation with
            Prof. Christoph Paus’ group at MIT. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also worked with the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), affiliated with the
            Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at UMD: my project there was on easing and curing the quantum Monte Carlo sign
            problem via boundary and physical phase transitions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
        </p>
        <p>
            I initially started my journey as a community college student at the Rockville campus of Montgomery College, where I
            earned my Associate of Science degree in Mathematics. I always knew my interests were in the physical and mathematical
            sciences, starting with the GRAD-MAP program which helped equip historically marginalized communities with basic
            research skills. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
