    <section id="about">
        <p>
            Hello there, my name is Othello (they/he): I am currently a Ph.D student in physics at the University of Cincinnati, aspiring to go into experimental particle physics.
            I am currently a Teaching Assistant for College Physics II for Spring 2026. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously, I was an undergraduate physics student at the University of Maryland, College Park. During my time at UMD, I was involved in a few projects ranging from theory to experiment: exoplanet astrophysics, quantum information science, and  particle physics. 
            I was recently involved with the <a href="http://flavor.physics.umd.edu/">Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) flavor physics group </a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/2060-pmham.html">Prof. Phoebe Hamilton</a> on <a href="https://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/about-us/news/department-news/2007-new-s25.html">R&D for the LHCb experiment's ECAL for Upgrades Ib and II</a>, an effort known as <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1386009/contributions/6279028/contribution.pdf">PicoCal</a> within the collaboration. 
            Prior to that, I worked on the analysis of the <a href ="https://indico.mit.edu/event/876/contributions/2875/">Z-Hadronic cross section comparing the difference between two MC generators</a> in the background, using its the uncertainty to apply cuts from LEP's L3 to final states of Z: this was done in affiliation with <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/christoph-paus/">Prof. Christoph Paus' group at MIT</a> as part of a particle physics I took in Spring 2024 at UMD taught by <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/1751-capalmer.html">Prof. Christopher Palmer.</a> 
            I have also worked with the <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/people/othello-gomes">Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS)</a>, which is affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at UMD (UMIACS): my project there was on curing the quantum Monte Carlo sign problem by exploring the connections between computational and physical phase transitions, on which I was advised by <a href="https://www.jacobbringewatt.com/">Prof. Jacob Bringewatt</a> & <a href="https://dhangleiter.github.io/">Dr. Dominik Hangleiter</a>.
            <br>
            <br>    
            I initially started my journey as a community college student at the Rockville campus of Montgomery College, where I received my Associate of Science degree in Mathematics. 
            I explored my interests in the mathematical & physics sciences through the <a href="https://www.umdgradmap.org/">GRAD-MAP</a> program. 
            During GRAD-MAP Summer Scholars, I worked under <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/komacek">Prof. Thaddeus Komacek</a>  on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/2022summerconference/home">reinflation of radii of Hot Jupiters orbiting post-main sequence stars</a>.
